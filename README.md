# Crop Disease Classification

Crop diseases significantly threaten agricultural productivity, leading to unstable food supply and economic losses. Current approaches to automated crop disease recognition face challenges such as:

- Limited datasets
- Restricted coverage of disease types
- Inefficient feature extraction

These challenges hinder the generalization of models across diverse crops and disease patterns. To address these issues, we propose an **efficient data augmentation method** aimed at enhancing the performance of deep learning models for crop disease recognition.

## Proposed Method

We constructed a new large-scale dataset comprising **24 different classes**, including both fruit and leaf samples. This dataset was designed to handle a variety of disease patterns and improve model generalization capabilities. The following techniques were employed:

- **Geometric transformations**
- **Color space augmentation techniques**

These techniques were applied to validate the efficiency of deep learning models, specifically **convolution** and **transformer models**, in recognizing multiple crop diseases.

## Experimental Results

Experimental results showed that these augmentation techniques significantly improved classification accuracy, achieving **F1 scores exceeding 98%**. Additionally, **feature map analysis** confirmed that the models effectively captured key disease characteristics.

## Conclusion

This study underscores the importance of **data augmentation** in developing automated, **energy-efficient**, and **environmentally sustainable** crop disease detection solutions. Our approach contributes to more **sustainable agricultural practices**.
